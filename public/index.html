                <p>In September 2018, Captain Vishal Khanna (LMOB, Kolkata, Batch of 1988) suffered a stroke on board
                    MV… while docking in Singapore, leaving him partially paralyzed. Vishal, the sole breadwinner, had a
                    family to support – his 92-year-old father, his wife Abha, and their two children, Yuthika and Yash.
                </p>

                <p>Friends and the LMOB Batch of 1988 provided initial financial and emotional support, but his stroke
                    wasn't considered "in the line of duty." After covering medical bills in Singapore and a few months
                    of hospitalization in Delhi, the family received no further compensation due to a tight employment
                    contract.</p>

                <p>Vishal's stroke plunged him into despair, but his determination and Abha's unwavering support
                    propelled him forward. Despite being fully dependent and having regained only partial function of
                    his left hand, he persevered.</p>

                <p>Fiercely independent, Vishal sought a way to support his family and regain purpose. Together with
                    Abha, he opened Captain Vishal’s Anchorage, a guesthouse in Vasant Kunj, Delhi.</p>

                <p>Their story is a testament to resilience, and your support for their business would be
                    greatly appreciated.</p>
